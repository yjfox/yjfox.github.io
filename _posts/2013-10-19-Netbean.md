**************

In the class, TA introduced an IDE called Netbeans, which would be used in our assignment 4.  
Netbeans is great, and has good extension. However, only the old version support XML schema plugin. which means we have to find a substitution of Netbeans.  
Fortunately, after research for a while, I came up with two solutions:  

### Solution 1: Find an old version of Netbeans  
It is not easy to find an old version, cause the provider of Netbeans prefer us download new one. So if you need an old one, please do next steps:

+ enter the homepage of Netbeans, click the download page, and choose Archive.    
+ choose old version, 7.2 and 7.1 are not old enough. Please download the version of 6.* - 7.0  
+ some versions are not available anymore, please try several times (choose 'daily' or 'release' or some other versions) until it works.  

But actually this solution sucks, not perfect and not geek.  
 

### Solution 2: Add XML tools in Netbeans7.4 (Preferred)  

+ open Netbeans7.4, click tools->plugin->settings  
+ click Add, and create a new update center. Name it whatever you like, copy next link into http filed  
> http://deadlock.netbeans.org/hudson/job/xml/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/updates/updates.xml
+ go back to the available plugin. Search XML. you will find XML tools, install it.  

Restart your Netbeans, now drag any .xsd file into Netbeans. If everything is good. There should be something like this picture:
