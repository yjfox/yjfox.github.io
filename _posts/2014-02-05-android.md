**************

### Step 1: 
- Download SDK, connect with your eclipse or netbeans.    
- Download google play service on SDK, and do same to all of android 4.4.2(latest)    
- Create an android project, copy SDK/extras/google/google-play-services/libproject/google-play-services_lib this folder into your projects' libs folder  
- a) for eclipse: Import the folder mentioned in 1.3, then right click your project and choose "android", add this library.  
  b) for netbeans: Right click your project and click libs, add this folder.

### Step 2:
- go to sdk/tools (or probably sdk/platform-tools in windows) in terminal. run command  

<code>
	android update lib-project --path "folder google-play-service's path   
	in your own project rather than its original one --target android-xx"  
</code>  

sometimes maybe need --target android-xx(xx is up to your emulator, mostly is 19 is you use android 4.4.2)  
- go back to IDE, click "clean and build", it should succeed. It can run on android devices but still doesn't work on emulator  
- download two apk files named: com.google.android.gms.apk and com.android.vending.apk, or your can **leave your email by reply**, I'll send these two to you ASAP  
- go to sdk/platform-tools in terminal, run command  

<code>
	adb install -r com.google.android.gms.apk/com.android.vending.apk  
    	(make sure these two files are in this directory, otherwise you need type absolute path)  
</code>  

- if it show failed, and with some information like "FAILED-SHARED-USERS", please follow next step 3, otherwise Congratulation! you made it.   

### *Step 3:
- command line:  

<code>
	adb shell chmod 666 /data/system/packages.xml   
        adb pull /data/system/packages.xml - get the packages.xml     
</code>  	 

- modify the packages.xml, delete all content between < shared-user> < /shared-user>
- command line:  

<code>
	adb push packages.xml /data/system - upload back to android  
	adb shell rm /data/dalvik-cache/*  
	adb reboot  
</code>  

- if you cannot use adb command, please restart adb -   

<code>
	adb kill-server  
	adb start-server  
	adb devices - see if your running emulator is showed on screen  
</code>	  

- if feedback is those two apk existed, then uninstall them by   

<code>
	adb uninstall  com.google.android.gms/com.android.vending  
</code>  

then install again.  

OK, all processes have been introduced. You may ask any question encountered by reply.  

end.
