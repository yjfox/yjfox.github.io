**************

As one of my final projects is related with LinkedIn, we need to get data via API. So I tried the instruction from LindedIn Developer.
However, the php code it provided could not work. After a bit research, a solution found.  

Find your folder <code>"/Apache/bin/php.ini"</code>  
uncommenting <code>;extension=php_ openssl.dll</code>  
add <code>allow_ url_include = On</code> in case of not working

end.
